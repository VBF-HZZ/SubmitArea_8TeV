The analyzer release should be created separately from the pattuplizer release due to differences in some packages needed, 
but the process of setting it up is very similar. Again there are two separate releases for 7 and 8 TeV, here we look at the 8 TeV release.

1.
	$ cmsrel CMSSW_5_3_9_patch3
	$ cd CMSSW_5_3_9_patch3/src
	$ cmsenv
	$ git clone git@github.com:VBF-HZZ/UFHZZAnalysis8TeV.git
	$ cp UFHZZAnalysis8TeV/Utilities/installPackages.py  ./
	$ cp UFHZZAnalysis8TeV/Utilities/packages_src.txt ./
	$ python installPackages.py 
	$ scram b -j12

2. Next, we need to setup the SubmitArea. ***Make sure this directory is just above CMSSW_5_3_9_patch3.***

	#continued from step 1
	$ cd ../../
	$ git clone git@github.com:VBF-HZZ/SubmitArea_8TeV.git
	$ cd SubmitArea_8TeV

In this directory, you will find several files

-listPatTuples.sh is used to list the files on the T2 that have come from the pattuplizer.
-Create_*_cfg.sh are used to create Submission directories in the proper format.
-submitFile.pbs.sh is the pbs script that will run when you submit to the HPC.
-Submit.sh is the script you will use to submit a Submission directory to run on the HPC.
-bin/ directory contains exe's that grab important info, such as cross section, 
 of the datasets when you run Create_*_cfg.sh scripts. The source for this is /cms/data/store/user/snowball/CrossSectionList.txt

This is how you would create analyzer submission directories after the output from the first section was done.

	$ ./listPatTuples.sh data/53X/Legacy_01.10/2012A    #will create patTuples directory
	$ mv patTuples Data_2012A
	$ ./Create_DATA_2012_cfg.sh Data_2012A #creates Submission_Data_2012A directory

Now check your submitFile.pbs.sh to make sure you have enough time and memory set for your job. Knowing this will only come with experience.
	
	$ ./Submit.sh Submission_Data_2012A #submits to the HPC

NOTE: We cannot compile CMSSW on the HPC as of now due to EL6 incompatibility with CMSSW versions. 
      Once we have slc6 SCRAM_ARCH CMSSW versions, we can go back to compiling on HPC. 
      Until then you have to make the release and compile on IHEPAs, then scp (or use /scratch/osghpc cross mounted disc) 
      the release to the HPC. When the job runs, it will edmPluginRefresh using the libraries anyway.


Once your jobs are done, they will return the output to results_Data_2012A where you can hadd them together or do as you please.
